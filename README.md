# HadoopMapReduce
Program to find word count of specific words and rank web pages based on the count

A Hadoop application that takes as input the 50 Wikipedia web pages dedicated to the US states and outputs: 

a) How many times each of the words “education”, “politics”, “sports”, and “agriculture” appear in the files. 
b) Rank the top 3 states for each of these words (i.e., which state pages use each of these words the most)
